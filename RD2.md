##### Objective
* Create a program to read in all the attendees and then output the seat assignments.
##### Procedure
* We understood the problem, determined the functions, wrote the code, tested code, wrote comments
* Following problem-solving techniques
Using for loops
Doing file I/O
Storing data in lists
Processing a list
##### Results
* The results matched how it should have
* We tried different inputs to test 
##### Reflection
* One of the challenges we faced were how to determine the functions
* We first understood programming, then coded, then tested
* We overcame our challenge by listening to Dr. Z talk about how to make the functions
* I became better at using for loops learnt how to open, use, and close files
* Yes
* It was good Working with Paige. We were on the same page when doing things. Together we were able to figure out
what to do and how to do it.
